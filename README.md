## CALBEARS - Determining Effect of Average Groundwater costs on Consumption
### Overview
This repository contains the analysis and findings from a project conducted for CALBEARS, focusing on understanding the impact of groundwater costs and electricity prices on groundwater consumption. The analysis involves using instrumental variable regression methodologies to estimate causal effects.
### Approach
The analysis is performed using a two-stage least squares (2SLS) regression methodology.

## Electricity Disconnection Impact Study
This repository contains the code and documentation for a study on the impact of electricity disconnection programs on payment behavior. The study employs statistical methods and the potential outcomes framework to estimate treatment effects.

### Overview
The main objective is to investigate the payment impacts of electricity disconnection programs. The analysis focuses on measuring the impact of treatment, defined as disconnecting a household's electricity, on household payments in rupees.

### Approach
The study explores the challenges in estimating treatment effects due to unobservable outcomes and discusses the use of average treatment effects (ATE) and average treatment effects on the treated (ATT).
Balance tests are conducted to ensure the randomization of treatment and control groups.
Regression analysis is performed to estimate treatment effects, considering various covariates.
It also highlights the importance of understanding the difference between Intent to Treat (ITT) estimates and actual treatment effects.

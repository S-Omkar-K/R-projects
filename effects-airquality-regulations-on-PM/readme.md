# Effects of Air Quality Regulations on Particulate Matter Levels in Muncipalities

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing the impact of air quality regulations on particulate matter (PM 2.5) levels in municipalities. The analysis employs regression analysis, difference-in-differences (DiD) estimation, and event study methodologies to understand the causal effects of introducing air quality regulations over time.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to assess the effectiveness of air quality regulations in reducing local particulate matter. Specific goals include:

- Estimating the difference in means between municipalities with and without air quality regulations.
- Implementing DiD analysis to identify the Average Treatment Effect (ATE) for municipalities introducing regulations in specific years.
- Conducting panel fixed effects regression to examine the causal impact of air quality regulations on particulate matter over time.

## Concepts Explored

### 1. Difference-in-Differences (DiD) Analysis
- Understanding the DiD methodology for estimating causal effects in observational studies.
- Investigating parallel trends assumption and its importance in DiD analysis.

### 2. Regression Analysis
- Implementing regression models to analyze the relationship between air quality regulations and particulate matter levels.
- Working with fixed effects to control for time-invariant municipality characteristics.

### 3. Event Study
- Utilizing event study methodology to observe the effects of air quality regulations over multiple time periods.

### 4. Panel Data Analysis
- Conducting panel fixed effects regression to control for individual municipality-specific effects.

## Findings and Interpretations

- The analysis reveals a significant reduction in particulate matter after the introduction of air quality regulations, as observed through various methodologies.
- The effectiveness of regulations varies across different years, with a notable impact persisting over time in certain cases.
- Identified shortcomings and potential biases in the analysis are discussed, emphasizing the need for careful interpretation.

## Recommendations

Based on the findings, the project recommends:

- Strong promotion and enforcement of air quality regulations.
- Further research to address potential biases and coincident treatments.
